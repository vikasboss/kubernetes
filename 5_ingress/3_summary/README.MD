# Summary

In this chapter, we explored the concept of Ingress in Kubernetes and its role in exposing HTTP routes to external clients. Let's recap what we've learned:

## Recap

- **Ingress Definition**: An Ingress is a Kubernetes resource used to expose HTTP routes to external clients. It acts as a smart router, directing traffic to different services based on defined rules.
  
- **Ingress Controller**: Before using Ingress, we need to have an Ingress Controller running in our cluster. We explored various open-source controllers available, and for our examples, we used the nginx ingress controller.

- **Routing Rules**: With Ingress, we can define different rules to route requests to specific services. These rules can be based on the path received, the host of the requests, or a combination of both.

- **Advantages over LoadBalancer**: In some scenarios, Ingress can offer similar functionality to several LoadBalancer services but with cost-effectiveness and enhanced routing capabilities.

In summary, Ingress provides a powerful way to manage HTTP routing in Kubernetes clusters, offering flexibility and cost-efficiency compared to traditional LoadBalancer services.
