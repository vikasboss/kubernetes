## Introduction

It’s common to be confused about when to use an Ingress instead of a LoadBalancer, so let’s try to clarify that.

## Ingress vs. LoadBalancer

An Ingress is not a service type. It acts as a smart router, directing traffic to services based on defined rules. On the other hand, a LoadBalancer provisions an entirely new load balancer for each service.

But couldn’t we achieve the same thing with several LoadBalancer services?

In some cases, we can, but there are advantages to using an Ingress.

## Advantages of Ingress

1. **Cost-Effectiveness**: For each LoadBalancer service, a new load balancer needs to be created. This can become expensive, especially if there are numerous services in the cluster. In contrast, an Ingress allows the same functionality with a single load balancer.

2. **Path-Based Routing**: Ingress enables setting up rules where requests to different paths are sent to different services. For instance, requests to `example.com/foo` can be directed to the `foo` service, while those to `example.com/bar` are routed to the `bar` service. Achieving this with individual LoadBalancer services would be cumbersome.

In summary, while a LoadBalancer is the easiest way to expose services, an Ingress provides more powerful routing capabilities, making it a preferred choice for complex scenarios.
